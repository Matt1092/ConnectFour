# ConnectFour
# This is a game that I created in Python. The board is made with the use of a 2D array. This is an object-oriented structured game where I have a Board class.
# The board class has all the basic functionalities of the game such as placing tokens on the board, checking for a winner, etc. 
# What I find special about this game is how I made the AI to counteract the user's moves (blocking and going for the win based on the algorithm that I created).
